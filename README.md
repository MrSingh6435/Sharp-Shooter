## 🧠 Core Concepts & Systems

- Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) in C#
- Unity’s **First-Person Starter Assets**
- **Scriptable Objects** for modular weapon design  
- **Raycasting & hit detection** for shooting mechanics  
- **Inheritance** for weapon pickups and ammo management  
- **Cooldown timers**, **screen shake recoil**, and **enemy damage logic**

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

### 🔫 Weapons
- **3 Unique Weapons:** Machine Gun, Sniper Rifle, and Pistol  
- Zoom functionality, custom animations, and **muzzle flash VFX**  
- Smooth **weapon switching** and **ammo management**

### 👾 Enemies & Combat
- **AI Enemies** using NavMesh pathfinding  
- Health and damage system  
- **Explosion VFX** and **Physics.OverlapSphere()** for AoE impact  
- **Enemy spawn portals** and **turret gun system** that tracks the player

### 🛡️ Player Mechanics
- Dynamic **player shield UI** and damage feedback  
- **Death camera transition** and **game-over sequences**
- **Win condition setup** for full gameplay loop

---

## 🎨 Design & Visuals

- **ProBuilder** for level blockout and map design  
- **Cinemachine** for smooth and cinematic camera transitions  
- **Post-processing effects** for enhanced visuals  
- **Custom fonts** using TextMeshPro Asset Creator  
- **Muzzle flash**, **bullet hit**, and **explosion VFX**

---

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- `Physics.OverlapSphere()` → Area of Effect (AoE) damage  
- `OnDrawGizmos()` → Explosion radius visualization  
- **Event System** for UI and in-game triggers  
- **Ternary operators** and **clean scripting patterns**

---

## 🔄 Additional Mechanics

- Weapon **switching & zoom**
- **Ammo pickups** and reload logic  
- **Enemy spawn control** and randomized waves  
- **Death cam** and smooth transitions
